Should come up with a word-wrap system.  The goofy inconsistent
wrapping is annoying.  I would build a pchar string in code (so that
pchar doesn’t become part of the global segment), then pass that to
(var) function that takes in pchar and dest string array, modifies the
array of 80-col strings and returns the number of strings; this info can
be used to build the menu.  Honor LF as a new line in the wrapping.
Crib off of TOPBENCH.  As for what column to wrap, that should be based
on size of text.  For example, should be determined by length of text
with 74*22 being max width of 74.  Clamp result between 74 and 40
minimum (so we don’t get 5-col-wide text windows that go down 22 lines).
So if you only have 240 chars, that would look like 11, but clamped to
40 it would be between 6-12 lines which is pleasing.
