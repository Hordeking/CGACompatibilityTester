# CGACompatibilityTester
The CGA Compatibility Tester, as its name implies, is a program that benchmarks and stresses nearly every capability of the IBM Color Graphics Adapter (CGA). This can be used to:

  * Verify that your clone CGA card is 100% compatible with the real IBM CGA
  * Similarly, verify how badly your non-CGA card (or software emulator) screws up CGA emulation
  * Benchmark adapter RAM speed, to compare with other adapters
  * Calibrate your CGA RGB monitor for maximum enjoyment
  * Satisfy your curiosity about how CGA can be tweaked
