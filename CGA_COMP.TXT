The CGA Compatibility Tester, as its name implies, is a program that
benchmarks and stresses nearly every capability of the IBM Color Graphics
Adapter (CGA).  This can be used to:

- Verify that your clone CGA card is 100% compatible with the real IBM CGA
- Calibrate your CGA RGB or Composite monitor for maximum enjoyment
- Calibrate your capture solution for accurate colors and motion
- Benchmark adapter RAM speed
- Satisfy your curiosity about how CGA can be tweaked
- Display neato 16-color transparent raster bars through the power of awesome
  (see the horizontal retrace detection test)
- Display 640x200x16 graphics the likes of which you have never seen
  (see the textmode row reprogramming test)

Testing Features:

...and MUCH, MUCH MORE(tm)

=============================================================================

Running the Program:

The CGA Compatibility Tester requires a CGA card, 128KB RAM, and DOS 3.1 or
higher.  256KB or more total RAM is highly recommended for maximum speed.
Every test is menu-driven, and follows this convention:

- Use arrow keys and ENTER to select a menu entry
- A description of the test will pop up
- Choose "continue" to run the test or "abort" to change your mind and go back

=============================================================================

Running in a Batch File (or: Let's Capture Some CGA Footage)

The following command-line arguments are recognized for generating a few
select test plates without user interaction.  This is intended for anyone
attempting to capture CGA video footage; they provide a quick way to generate
various screens and tone to be used as a reference later during editing.

Command-line arguments are:

Argument  | Action
----------+-------
/nXX      | Delay XX seconds (default = 5) before exiting a test plate.
aspect    | Display the NTSC monitor aspect ratio calibration test.
cbars     | Display composite default color bars sorted by luminance.
rbars     | Display RGBI calibration bars (meant for capture devices).
motion    | Display 60Hz motion test.  (Runs for 8 seconds; ignores /n values)
audiosync | Display video+audio sync test
/?, /h    | Display this help text.

You can mix and match these on a single command-line.  For example, if trying
to capture composite CGA, this would make a good leader:

CGA_COMP /n10 audiosync aspect cbars motion audiosync

Each test plate will display for 10 seconds before moving to the second
test.  Also note that "audiosync" is provided both at the beginning and the
end so that the resulting capture has "sync and tone" at both ends, allowing
detection of severe audio drift problems.

Hint: If you are capturing very long sessions, such as over an hour, run the
audiosync test before stopping your capture.  That way, you'll have
sync+tone at the beginning and end that you can use to detect subtle drift.

=============================================================================

DISCLAIMER:

I have a vintage collection just like you, and I would never intentionally
damage hardware.  That said, you run this program at your own risk. I cannot
be held liable for any damage that may occur to your computer hardware by
running any of these tests.  By using this program, you agree to these terms.

=============================================================================

Limitations:

- Row/column reprogramming not implemented in graphics mode due to
  lack of motivation.  It is implemented in text mode, and it uses the
  same methods, so this is no great loss.
- Light pen interface not tested because I do not own a light pen.
  Please send me a light pen.
- 4 colors in 640x200 mode (yes, 640x200x4) not implemented because, while
  the *mode* works, IBM didn't implement things properly and memory is
  incompletely decoded (every other byte column is garbage).  No software
  ever used this half-implemented feature.

Notes and Oddities:

The interlaced support, as implemented by IBM in the CGA and as connected to
an IBM 5153 color RGB monitor, is broken.  What is *supposed* to happen is
that the interlaced mode would display one frame of scanlines, then display a
second frame of scanlines offset by one field.  What ACTUALLY happens on CGA
is that every set of scanlines, whether odd or even, are displayed in the
same locations.  This has the effect of mashing both sets of scanlines
together into 200 lines, instead of an interlacted 400-line mode as you'd
normally expect.  (This was tested with a composite display as well as RGB
and the results were no better.)  If you've ever wondered why no program in
the history of the IBM PC ever used interlaced CGA mode, now you know!

There are ways to use interlaced functionalty in interesting configurations
that can potentially lead to new CGA video modes.  This is left as an
exercise for the reader.

Version History:

0.1:  Testing release, has half the functions added
0.2:  Added rest of testing functions
0.3:  Added system and graphics detection library
0.4:  Added 8087 emulator (detection routines require $N+); also created
      a video of the program in action on real hardware for reference.
      Visit the website for a link to the video.
0.5:  Fixed 8088 detection logic (hopefully didn't break NEC logic!)

0.5a: Fixed PC detection logic
      Added Tandy 1000 detection logic

      Added vertical/horizontal motion video capture torture test.
      Added capture dropped frame and audio/video sync test.
      Added IRGB pin and color text labels to the uniformity test.
      Completely rewrote vertical refresh rate detection because I'm an idiot.
      Added command-line options for batch usage; see documentation above.
1.21: Added tone+flash when shift is pressed in sync test for manual syncing.
      Fixed a stack overflow bug.
1.22: Disabled hsync+vsync on uniformity test to enable diagnostic measurement.
      Arranged composite luma bars in test plate to reflect logical ideal.
1.23: Added horizontal and vertical lines to 40-col test for checking jitter.
1.24: Fixed counter rollover bug in audio sync test.
1.25: Added color bars monitor calibration plate back into the program.

Possible future enhancements:
- Add full "monochrome CGA" support (both main program and calibration: 5155,
  AT&T 6300, Compaq Portable III, others?)
- Add full support for "mode bw80" (related to the previous to-do item)
- Add light pen support, if someone would make or give me a light pen!
